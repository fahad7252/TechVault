                <h1>TechVault: Preserving Our Digital Memories</h1>

                <p class="intro">Remember your first computer? That clunky desktop that whirred to life every morning,
                    greeting you with its familiar startup sound. Or maybe it was that flip phone you carried through
                    high school, the one with the tiny screen and endless text messages. These devices weren't just
                    tools – they were companions on our journey through life.</p>

                <p>In today's rapid-fire world of technological advancement, we often forget these faithful digital
                    companions. That old iPod that got you through countless workouts, the GameBoy that made long car
                    rides bearable, or your first smartphone that opened up a world of possibilities – they all have
                    stories to tell.</p>

                <p class="highlight">That's why we created TechVault.</p>
